Open Source Software Project Template for WileyLabs Projects

## Usage

Clone this repository locally or otherwise extract the files you need to add
to your project.

Rename **either** the `LICENSE.mit` or `LICENSE.apache` file
to `LICENSE` and delete the other one.

Be sure to state any license selection in your software's packaging settings.

Lastly, use the `NOTICE` file to track any code copy/pasted into your projects
code or directly included within this repository. Package manager-based
dependencies need not be recorded here, but you should still be aware of their
license requirements before using them.
